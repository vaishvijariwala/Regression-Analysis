`PROJECT OVERVIEW`

 **Data Analysis Assignment** 

Here, I successfully executed a two-part linear regression analysis. In Part A, I adeptly merged files based on subject ID, addressed missing data, and implemented a chosen imputation method. Part B extended the analysis to a comprehensive examination of subject ID data, involving transformations and lack of fit testing.

**Accomplishments:**

- Seamlessly merged two files based on subject ID.
- Implemented an effective imputation method for missing data.
- Conducted in-depth regression analysis and lack of fit testing for subject ID data.

**Key Learnings:**

- Enhanced skills in imputation strategies and their impact on analysis outcomes.
- Deepened understanding of regression techniques, transformations, and statistical interpretation.
- Applied statistical software, such as R, for efficient data analysis in a real-world context.

In summary, this project provided practical experience in data analysis, showcasing my ability to handle complex data challenges and extract meaningful insights.
